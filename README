This is a Haskell library for writing CGI programs.

Requirements:

GHC 6.4 or later. Not yet tested with other Haskell implementations.

The FastPackedString package, available from
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/fps.html
Some recent additions to FastPackedString are used,
so at the moment you need the current darcs version.

The Haskell XHtml combinator library from
http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~bringert/darcs/haskell-xhtml/doc/

Installation:

$ runghc Setup.hs configure
$ runghc Setup.hs build
